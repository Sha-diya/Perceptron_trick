# Perceptron Trick â€“ Python Implementation

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Perceptron Trick**, a fundamental concept in machine learning.  
The Perceptron algorithm is a **linear classifier** used for binary classification tasks and serves as a building block for more complex neural networks.

**ðŸ“˜ About the Perceptron Trick**

The Perceptron Trick involves updating the weights of the Perceptron model whenever a misclassification occurs.
This iterative process allows the model to converge towards an optimal decision boundary for linearly separable data.

*Key Steps:*
1. Initialize weights and bias to zero (or small random values).
2. For each training sample:
   - Compute the output using the current weights.
   - Update weights if the prediction is wrong:
     ```bash
     w = w + learning_rate * (y_true - y_pred) * x
     b = b + learning_rate * (y_true - y_pred)
     ```
3. Repeat for multiple epochs until convergence.
